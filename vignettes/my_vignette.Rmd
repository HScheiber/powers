The `powers` package is an R package with a few functions that can be used as an alternative to the `^` or `**` operators.

Below are some example usages of the functions found in this package.

You can easily square or cube numerical data.
```{r}
square(2)
cube(3.5)
```

The functions in this package can also be used to take vectors of numbers to powers.
```{r}
square(1:10)
cube(1:10)
```

The functions also work on logical data, coercing it to numerical data.
```{r}
square(TRUE)
cube(FALSE)
```
